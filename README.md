<blockquote>The styling in our HTML wireframes should be minimal. We limit our color palette to black, white, and shades of grey. We limit our typography to some simple defaults. We limit our layout to a single column that will look fine on mobile devices, which will set us up nicely for progressively enhancing our app for larger screen sizes later in the development process.</blockquote>
